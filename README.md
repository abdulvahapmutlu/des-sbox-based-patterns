# DES SBox-based Patterns for 1D Signal Feature Extraction
These MATLAB functions implement feature extraction methods based on DES (Data Encryption Standard) SBox patterns for one-dimensional signal processing tasks.

These functions take a one-dimensional signal as input and return a histogram of features extracted using DES SBox patterns.

Note: The input signal should have a length greater than 15 to ensure proper feature extraction.
